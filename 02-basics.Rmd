# Basics

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both

- save and execute code, and

- generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience.

R Markdown was designed for easier reproducibility, since both the computing code and narratives are in the same document, and results are automatically generated from the source code. R Markdown supports dozens of static and dynamic/interactive output formats.

If you prefer a video introduction to R Markdown, we recommend that you check out the website https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com, and watch the videos in the "Get Started" section, which cover the basics of R Markdown.

Below is a minimal R Markdown document, which should be a plain text file, with the conventional extension `.Rmd`:

```{r include=FALSE}
b = '`r b[1]`'  # an ugly hack; don't look at me
```
```yaml
---
title: "Hello R Markdown"
author: "Awesome Me"
date: "2018-02-14"
output: html_document
---
```
````markdown
This is a paragraph in an R Markdown document.

Below is a code chunk:

`r ''````{r, lm-cars, fig.height=5}
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b   = coef(fit)
plot(fit)
```

The slope of the regression is `r b[1]`.
```
````

There are three basic components of an R Markdown document: the metadata, text, and code. The metadata is written between the pair of three dashes `---`. The syntax for the metadata is YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), so sometimes it is also called the YAML metadata or the YAML frontmatter. Before it bites you hard, we want to warn you in advance that indentation matters in YAML, so do not forget to indent the sub-fields of a top field properly. See the [Appendix B.2](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/r-markdown.html) of @xie2016 for a few simple examples that show the YAML syntax.

The body of a document follows the metadata. The syntax for text (also known as prose or narratives) is Markdown, which is introduced in Section \@ref(markdown-syntax). There are two types of computer code, which are explained in detail in Section \@ref(r-code-syntax):

- A code chunk starts with three backticks like ```` ```{r} ```` where `r` indicates the language name, and ends with three backticks. You can write chunk options in the curly braces.

- An inline R code expression starts with `` `r `` and ends with a backtick `` ` ``.

Figure \@ref(fig:hello-rmd) shows the above example in the RStudio IDE. You can click the `Knit` button to compile the document (to an HTML page).

```{r hello-rmd, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A minimal R Markdown example in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/hello-rmd.png', dpi = NA)
```

Now please take a closer look at the example. Did you notice a problem? The object `b` is the vector of coefficients of length 2 from the linear regression; `b[1]` is actually the intercept, and `b[2]` is the slope! This minimal example shows you why R Markdown is great for reproducible research: it includes the source code right inside the document, which makes it easy to discover and fix problems, as well as update the output document. All you have to do is change `b[1]` to `b[2]`, and click the `Knit` button again. Had you copied a number `-17.579` computed elsewhere into this document, it would be very difficult to realize the problem. In fact, I had used this example a few times by myself before I discovered this problem, but I discovered it anyway.

It is fine for humans to err (in computing), as long as the source code is readily available.

## Compile an R Markdown document {#compile}

The usual way to compile an R Markdown document is to click the `Knit` button as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hello-rmd), and the corresponding keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl + Shift + K` (`Cmd + Shift + K` on macOS). Under the hood, RStudio calls the function `rmarkdown::render()` to render the document _in a new R session_. Please note the emphasis here, which often confuses R Markdown users. Rendering an Rmd document in a new R session means that none of the objects in your current R session (e.g., those you created in your R console) are available to that session.^[This is not strictly true, but mostly true. You may save objects in your current R session to a file, e.g., `.RData`, and load it in a new R session.] Reproducibility is the main reason that RStudio uses a new R session to render your Rmd documents: in most cases, you may want your documents to continue to work the next time you open R, or in other people's computing environments. See [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48494678/559676) if you want to know more.

If you must render a document in the current R session, you can also call `rmarkdown::render()` by yourself, and pass the path of the Rmd file to this function. The second argument of this function is the output format, which defaults to the first output format you specify in the YAML metadata (if it is missing, the default is `html_document`). When you have multiple output formats in the metadata, and do not want to use the first one, you can specify the one you want in the second argument, e.g., for an Rmd document `foo.Rmd` with the metadata:

```yaml
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
  pdf_document:
    keep_tex: true
```

You can render it to PDF via:

```r
rmarkdown::render('foo.Rmd', 'pdf_document')
```

The function call gives you much more freedom (e.g., you can generate a series of reports in a loop), but you should bear reproducibility in mind when you render documents this way.

Another main way to work with Rmd documents is the R Markdown Notebooks, which will be introduced in Section \@ref(notebook). With notebooks, you can run code chunks individually and see results right inside the RStudio editor. This is a convenient way to interact or experiment with code in an Rmd document, because you do not have to compile the whole document. Again, for the sake of reproducibility, you will need to compile the whole document eventually in a clean environment.

Lastly, I want to mention an "unofficial" way to compile Rmd documents: the function `xaringan::inf_mr()`, or equivalently, the RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader". Obviously, this requires you to install the **xaringan** package [@R-xaringan], which is available on CRAN. The main advantage of this way is LiveReload: a technology that enables you to live preview the output as soon as you save the source document, and you do not need to hit the `Knit` button. This only works for Rmd documents that output to HTML.

A few R Markdown extension packages, such as **bookdown** and **blogdown**, have their own way of compiling documents, and we will introduce them later.

## Cheat sheets

RStudio has created a large number of cheatsheets, including the one-page R Markdown cheetsheet, which are freely available at https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/. There is also a more detailed R Markdown reference guide. Both documents can be used as quick references after you become more familiar with R Markdown.
