# Basics

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both

- save and execute code, and

- generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience.

R Markdown was designed for easier reproducibility, since both the computing code and narratives are in the same document, and results are automatically generated from the source code. R Markdown supports dozens of static and dynamic/interactive output formats.

If you prefer a video introduction to R Markdown, we recommend that you check out the website https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com, and watch the videos in the "Get Started" section, which cover the basics of R Markdown.

Below is a minimal R Markdown document, which should be a plain-text file, with the conventional extension `.Rmd`:

```{r include=FALSE}
b = '`r b[1]`'  # an ugly hack; don't look at me
```
```yaml
---
title: "Hello R Markdown"
author: "Awesome Me"
date: "2018-02-14"
output: html_document
---
```
````markdown
This is a paragraph in an R Markdown document.

Below is a code chunk:

`r ''````{r, lm-cars, fig.height=5}
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b   = coef(fit)
plot(fit)
```

The slope of the regression is `r b[1]`.
```
````

There are three basic components of an R Markdown document: the metadata, text, and code. The metadata is written between the pair of three dashes `---`. The syntax for the metadata is YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), so sometimes it is also called the YAML metadata or the YAML frontmatter. Before it bites you hard, we want to warn you in advance that indentation matters in YAML, so do not forget to indent the sub-fields of a top field properly. See the [Appendix B.2](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/r-markdown.html) of @xie2016 for a few simple examples that show the YAML syntax.

The body of a document follows the metadata. The syntax for text (also known as prose or narratives) is Markdown, which is introduced in Section \@ref(markdown-syntax). There are two types of computer code, which are explained in detail in Section \@ref(r-code-syntax):

- A code chunk starts with three backticks like ```` ```{r} ```` where `r` indicates the language name, and ends with three backticks. You can write chunk options in the curly braces.

- An inline R code expression starts with `` `r `` and ends with a backtick `` ` ``.

Figure \@ref(fig:hello-rmd) shows the above example in the RStudio IDE. You can click the `Knit` button to compile the document (to an HTML page).

```{r hello-rmd, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A minimal R Markdown example in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/hello-rmd.png', dpi = NA)
```

Now please take a closer look at the example. Did you notice a problem? The object `b` is the vector of coefficients of length 2 from the linear regression; `b[1]` is actually the intercept, and `b[2]` is the slope! This minimal example shows you why R Markdown is great for reproducible research: it includes the source code right inside the document, which makes it easy to discover and fix problems, as well as update the output document. All you have to do is change `b[1]` to `b[2]`, and click the `Knit` button again. Had you copied a number `-17.579` computed elsewhere into this document, it would be very difficult to realize the problem. In fact, I had used this example a few times by myself before I discovered this problem, but I discovered it anyway.

It is fine for humans to err (in computing), as long as the source code is readily available.

## Compile an R Markdown document {#compile}

The usual way to compile an R Markdown document is to click the `Knit` button as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hello-rmd), and the corresponding keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl + Shift + K` (`Cmd + Shift + K` on macOS). Under the hood, RStudio calls the function `rmarkdown::render()` to render the document _in a new R session_. Please note the emphasis here, which often confuses R Markdown users. Rendering an Rmd document in a new R session means that none of the objects in your current R session (e.g., those you created in your R console) are available to that session.^[This is not strictly true, but mostly true. You may save objects in your current R session to a file, e.g., `.RData`, and load it in a new R session.] Reproducibility is the main reason that RStudio uses a new R session to render your Rmd documents: in most cases, you may want your documents to continue to work the next time you open R, or in other people's computing environments. See [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48494678/559676) if you want to know more.

If you must render a document in the current R session, you can also call `rmarkdown::render()` by yourself, and pass the path of the Rmd file to this function. The second argument of this function is the output format, which defaults to the first output format you specify in the YAML metadata (if it is missing, the default is `html_document`). When you have multiple output formats in the metadata, and do not want to use the first one, you can specify the one you want in the second argument, e.g., for an Rmd document `foo.Rmd` with the metadata:

```yaml
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
  pdf_document:
    keep_tex: true
```

You can render it to PDF via:

```r
rmarkdown::render('foo.Rmd', 'pdf_document')
```

The function call gives you much more freedom (e.g., you can generate a series of reports in a loop), but you should bear reproducibility in mind when you render documents this way.

Another main way to work with Rmd documents is the R Markdown Notebooks, which will be introduced in Section \@ref(notebook). With notebooks, you can run code chunks individually and see results right inside the RStudio editor. This is a convenient way to interact or experiment with code in an Rmd document, because you do not have to compile the whole document. Again, for the sake of reproducibility, you will need to compile the whole document eventually in a clean environment.

Lastly, I want to mention an "unofficial" way to compile Rmd documents: the function `xaringan::inf_mr()`, or equivalently, the RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader". Obviously, this requires you to install the **xaringan** package [@R-xaringan], which is available on CRAN. The main advantage of this way is LiveReload: a technology that enables you to live preview the output as soon as you save the source document, and you do not need to hit the `Knit` button. This only works for Rmd documents that output to HTML.

A few R Markdown extension packages, such as **bookdown** and **blogdown**, have their own way of compiling documents, and we will introduce them later.

## Cheat sheets

RStudio has created a large number of cheatsheets, including the one-page R Markdown cheetsheet, which are freely available at https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/. There is also a more detailed R Markdown reference guide. Both documents can be used as quick references after you become more familiar with R Markdown.

## Output formats

There are two types of output formats in the **rmarkdown** package: documents, and presentations. All available formats are listed below:

`r knitr::combine_words(grep('^[^_]+_(document|presentation)$', ls(asNamespace('rmarkdown')), value = TRUE), sep = '\n', and = '', before = '- \x60', after = '\x60')`

We will document these output formats in detail in Chapters \@ref(documents) and \@ref(presentations). There are more output formats provided in other extension packages (Chapter \@ref(extensions)). For the output format names in the YAML metadata of an Rmd file, you need to include the package name if a format is from an extension package, e.g.,

```yaml
output: tufte::tufte_html
```

If the format is from the **rmarkdown** package, you do not need the `rmarkdown::` prefix (although it will not hurt).

When there are multiple output formats in a document, there will be a dropdown menu behind the RStudio `Knit` button that lists the output format names (Figure \@ref(fig:format-dropdown)).

```{r format-dropdown, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The output formats listed in the dropdown menu on the RStudio toolbar.', out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/format-dropdown.png', dpi = NA)
```

Each output format is often accompanied with several format options. All these options are documented on the R package help pages. For example, you can type `?rmarkdown::html_document` in R to open the help page of the `html_document` format. When you want to use certain options, you have to translate the values from R to YAML, e.g.,

```r
html_document(toc = TRUE, toc_depth = 2, dev = 'svg')
```

can be written in YAML as:

```yaml
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    dev: 'svg'
```

The translation is often straightforward. Remember that R's `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NULL` are `true`, `false`, and `null`, respectively, in YAML. Character strings in YAML often do not require the quotes (e.g., `dev: 'svg'` and `dev: svg` are the same), unless they contain special characters, such as the colon `:`. If you are not sure if a string should be quoted or not, test it with the **yaml** package, e.g.,

```{r test-yaml, tidy=FALSE, comment='', class.output='yaml'}
cat(yaml::as.yaml(list(
  title = 'A Wonderful Day',
  subtitle = 'hygge: a quality of coziness'
)))
```

Note that the subtitle in the above example is quoted because of the colon.

If a certain option has sub-options (which means the value of this option is a list in R), the sub-options need to be further indented, e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    includes:
      in_header: header.html
      before_body: before.html
```

Some options are passed to **knitr**, such as `dev`, `fig_width`, and `fig_height`. Detailed documentation of these options can be found on the **knitr** documentation page: https://yihui.name/knitr/options/. Note that the actual **knitr** option names can be different. In particular, **knitr** uses `.` in names, but **rmarkdown** uses `_`, e.g., `fig_width` in **rmarkdown** corresponds to `fig.width` in **knitr**. We apologize for the inconsistencies---programmers often strive for consistencies in their own world, yet one standard plus one standard often equals three standards. If I were to write the **knitr** package again, I would definitely use `_`.

Some options are passed to Pandoc, such as `toc`, `toc_depth`, and `number_sections`. You should consult the Pandoc documentation when in doubt. R Markdown output format functions often have a `pandoc_args` argument, which should be a character vector of extra arguments to be passed to Pandoc. If you find any Pandoc features that are not represented by the output format arguments, you may use this ultimate argument, e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  pdf_document:
    toc: true
    pandoc_args: ["--wrap=none", "--top-level-division=chapter"]
```

## Markdown syntax

The text in an R Markdown document is written with the Markdown syntax. Precisely speaking, it is Pandoc's Markdown. There are many flavors of Markdown invented by different people, and Pandoc's flavor is the most comprehensive one to our knowledge. You can find the full documentation of Pandoc's Markdown at https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html. We strongly recommend that you read this page at least once to know all the possibilities with Pandoc's Markdown, even if you will not use all of them. This section is adapted from [Section 2.1](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-syntax.html) of @xie2016, and only covers a small subset of Pandoc's Markdown syntax.

### Inline formatting

Inline text will be _italic_ if surrounded by underscores or asterisks, e.g., `_text_` or `*text*`. **Bold** text is produced using a pair of double asterisks (`**text**`). A pair of tildes (`~`) turn text to a subscript (e.g., `H~3~PO~4~` renders H~3~PO~4~). A pair of carets (`^`) produce a superscript (e.g., `Cu^2+^` renders Cu^2+^).

To mark text as `inline code`, use a pair of backticks, e.g., `` `code` ``. To include literal backticks, use more backticks outside, e.g., you can use two backticks to preserve one backtick inside: ``` `` `code` `` ```.

Links are created using `[text](link)`, e.g., `[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)`, and the syntax for images is similar: just add an exclamation mark, e.g., `![alt text or image title](path/to/image)`. Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`, e.g., `^[This is a footnote.]`.

There are multiple ways to insert citations, and we recommend that you use BibTeX databases, because they work better when the output format is LaTeX/PDF. [Section 2.8](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html) of @xie2016 has covered the details. The key idea is that when you have a BibTeX database (a plain-text file with the conventional filename extension `.bib`) that contains entries like:

```bibtex
@Manual{R-base,
  title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical
    Computing},
  author = {{R Core Team}},
  organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
  address = {Vienna, Austria},
  year = {2017},
  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
}
```

You may add a field named `bibliography` to the YAML metadata, and set its value to the path of the BibTeX file. Then in Markdown, you may use `@R-base` or `[@R-base]` to reference the BibTeX entry. Pandoc will automatically generated a list of references in the end of the document.

### Block-level elements

Section headers can be written after a number of pound signs, e.g.,

```markdown
# First-level header

## Second-level header

### Third-level header
```

If you do not want a certain heading to be numbered, you can add `{-}` or `{.unnumbered}` after the heading, e.g.,

```markdown
# Preface {-}
```

Unordered list items start with `*`, `-`, or `+`, and you can nest one list within another list by indenting the sub-list,^[The default rules for indenting in Pandoc 1.19 and 2.0 are different. For Pandoc before 2.0, you should indent by four spaces. The current Pandoc documentation reflects rules for Pandoc >= 2.0.] e.g.,

```markdown
- one item
- one item
- one item
```

The output is:

- one item
- one item
- one item

Ordered list items start with numbers (the rule for nested lists is the same as above), e.g.,

```markdown
1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
```

The output does not look too much different with the Markdown source:

1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item

Blockquotes are written after `>`, e.g.,

```markdown
> "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."
>
> --- Mark Twain
```

The actual output (we customized the style for blockquotes in this book):

> "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."
>
> --- Mark Twain

Plain code blocks can be written after three or more backticks, and you can also indent the blocks by four spaces, e.g.,

````markdown
```
This text is displayed verbatim / preformatted
```

Or indent by four spaces:

    This text is displayed verbatim / preformatted
````

In general, you'd better leave at least one empty line between adjacent but different elements, e.g., a header and a paragraph. This is to avoid ambiguity to the Markdown renderer. For example, does `#` indicate a header below?

```markdown
In R, the character
# indicates a comment.
```

And does `-` mean a bullet point below?

```markdown
The result of 5
- 3 is 2.
```

Different flavors of Markdown may produce different results if there are no blank lines.

### Math expressions

Inline LaTeX equations\index{LaTeX math expression} can be written in a pair of dollar signs using the LaTeX syntax, e.g., `$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$` (actual output: $f(k)={n \choose k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$); math expressions of the display style can be written in a pair of double dollar signs, e.g., `$$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$`, and the output looks like this:

$$f\left(k\right)=\binom{n}{k}p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}$$

You can also use math environments inside `$ $` or `$$ $$`, e.g.,

```latex
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13}\\
x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23}
\end{array}$$
```

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13}\\
x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23}
\end{array}$$

```latex
$$X = \begin{bmatrix}1 & x_{1}\\
1 & x_{2}\\
1 & x_{3}
\end{bmatrix}$$
```

$$X = \begin{bmatrix}1 & x_{1}\\
1 & x_{2}\\
1 & x_{3}
\end{bmatrix}$$

```latex
$$\Theta = \begin{pmatrix}\alpha & \beta\\
\gamma & \delta
\end{pmatrix}$$
```

$$\Theta = \begin{pmatrix}\alpha & \beta\\
\gamma & \delta
\end{pmatrix}$$

```latex
$$\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$
```

$$\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$
