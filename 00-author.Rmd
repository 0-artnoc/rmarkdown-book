# About the Authors {#author .unnumbered}

This book is primarily put together by Yihui Xie based on the existing R documentation of the **rmarkdown** package and the **rmarkdown** website, which were mainly contributed by J. J. Allaire and Garret Grolemund.

Yihui Xie (<https://yihui.name>) is a software engineer at RStudio (<https://www.rstudio.com>). He earned his PhD from the Department of Statistics, Iowa State University. He is interested in interactive statistical graphics and statistical computing. As an active R user, he has authored several R packages, such as **knitr**, **bookdown**, **blogdown**, **xaringan**, **tinytex**, **animation**, **DT**, **tufte**, **formatR**, **fun**, **xfun**, **mime**, **highr**, **servr**, and **Rd2roxygen**, among which the **animation** package won the 2009 John M.

He has authored two books "Dynamic Documents with knitr" [@xie2015] and "bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown" [@xie2016], and co-authored the book "blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown" [@xie2017].

In 2006, he founded the Capital of Statistics (<https://cosx.org>), which has grown into a large online community on statistics in China. He initiated the Chinese R conference in 2008, and has been involved in organizing R conferences in China since then. During his PhD training at Iowa State University, he won the Vince Sposito Statistical Computing Award (2011) and the Snedecor Award (2012) in the Department of Statistics.

He occasionally rants on Twitter (https://twitter.com/xieyihui), and most of the time you can find him on GitHub (https://github.com/yihui).

He enjoys spicy food as much as classical Chinese literature.
